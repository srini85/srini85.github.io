### About Course

This course is aimed at the young children who may have have been introduced to block based coding (although not a requirement). We will walk through the fundamentals of block based code and step through a series of exerices to help kids think and solve problems with code.

### How it is run

* 12 Week course
* 8 modules will be run online in groups
* 4 modules will be face to face
* Each session will run for 1 hour
* Prework and homework for some modules may be required

<sup>Course structure may change based on regulations and availabilities</sup>

### What they will learn and do

* Introduction to Coding with blocks using Google developed software called - blockly
* Develop their understanding of computer science fundamentals
* Solve puzzles and games with block based code
* Work with experts in the Computer science field to break down large problems and come up with solutions 
* Perform mathematics, computational and logical problems
* Work with other kids to problem solve and build apps and games they can share

### Key Outcomes

* Learn the fundamentals of computer science in a fun an exciting way
* Be able to think logically to solve real world problems
* Learn problem solving techniques as individuals and groups 
* Foster creativity and bring things to life with code
* Utilising trial and error techniques to come up with solutions
* Enhance graphical design skills 
* Develop skills in all aspects of STEM (Science, technology, engineering and mathematics)
