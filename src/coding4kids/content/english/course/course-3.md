### About Course

This course is aimed at the young children who have used block based languages before and are now ready to take their knowledge to the next level. We will recap the basic fundamentals of coding before getting into exciting content that will enable the children to be creative and build real life games and applications.

### How it is run

* 12 Week course
* 8 modules will be run online in groups
* 4 modules will be face to face
* Each session will run for 1 hour
* Prework and homework for some modules may be required

<sup>Course structure may change based on regulations and availabilities</sup>

### What they will learn and do

* Introduction to Coding with blocks using Google developed software called - blockly
* Refresh their understanding of computer science fundamentals
* Dive into deeper concepts of coding through interactive games
* Look at block based and text based code
* Go through a series of exercises week on week to end up making a game
* Work with robotics kits and program them to solve problems
* Work with experts in the Computer science field to break down large problems and come up with solutions 
* Perform mathematics, computational and logical problems
* Work with other kids to problem solve and build apps and games they can share

### Key Outcomes

* Learn the fundamentals of computer science in a fun an exciting way
* Be able to create apps and games to solve real world problems
* Learn Problem solving techniques as individuals and groups 
* Be comfortable in working with text based coding environments
* Logical thinking skills that can be applied all around us
* Foster creativity and bring things to life with code
* Utilising trial and error techniques to come up with solutions
* Enhance graphical design skills
